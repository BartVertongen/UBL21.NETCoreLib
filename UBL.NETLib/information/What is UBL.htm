        <p>The world of business is fueled by documents such as orders, invoices and waybills that
        are sent between trading partners such as buyers, sellers, shippers and warehouses. For many
        years, expensive Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) implementations on costly value-added
        networks have fulfilled the need to express such documents in a machine-processable form for
        software applications to act on the contents found therein. Until the first publishing of
        the OASIS Universal Business Language (UBL) in 2003 as an open, customizable and extensible
        XML vocabulary of business documents, custom-tailored XML-based replacements had come and
        gone in experimental forms and proposals by vendors, never gaining the traction needed to be
        adopted by business or sanctioned by governments for use over the Internet. Growing in scope
        and use in new releases, the global perspective and acceptance of OASIS UBL was bolstered in
        2015 when governments worldwide ratified OASIS UBL as International Standard ISO/IEC
        19845.</p>
<p>There are a number of established XML vocabularies for families of document types. The Text
    Encoding Initiative (TEI), as an example, is for electronic texts for scholarly research such as
    prose, drama and poetry. The Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information
    Standards (OASIS) is responsible for a number of other examples. OASIS DocBook is for technical
    documentation comprising books and articles. The OASIS Open Document Format (ODF),
    internationally standardized as ISO/IEC 26300, is for office applications including
    spreadsheets, documents and presentations. </p><p>The commercial invoice is but one of a family of 65 document types formally described as
    semantic business objects in business documents, each with an associated XML schema, in the
    OASIS Universal Business Language (UBL) Standard, also internationally standardized as ISO/IEC
    19845.</p><p>In 2004 a study for the Danish Government by KPMG, a professional services company, reported
    that Danish public institutions received approximately 1.25 million paper invoices per month at
    an approximate cost of processing that paper of €10 per invoice. The use of OASIS UBL was
    legislated for all government procurement to start in February 2005. By October 2005 95% of all
    invoices sent to Danish public institutions were in UBL XML. The government reported in <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/36397"><code>http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/36397</code></a> that by
    2010 more than 30,000 public sector endpoints received invoices from 175,000 private companies,
    all using XML invoices in the UBL vocabulary. In that time a documented total of €500 million
    had been saved just by the government, net of the costs of development and deployment. This
    doesn't include the savings for companies in private industry who dealt with the government and
    also jumped onto the national network to send invoices to each other.</p><p>In September 2008 European stakeholders in public procurement with government created the
    Pan-European Public Procurement On-line (PEPPOL) project jointly funded by the European
    Commission to support business-to-government supply. In <a href="http://www.peppol.eu/news/electronic-invoicing-in-norway-a-story-of-success"><code>http://www.peppol.eu/news/electronic-invoicing-in-norway-a-story-of-success</code></a>
    it is reported that at the beginning of 2014 over 50% of the network was being used for
    business-to-business transactions:</p><div><blockquote><p>In January
 2014, an important milestone was reached when the entity number 10.000 
was
      registered as a recipient ... Most of these organisations have 
capability to receive eInvoices. ... Among the over 10.000 
organisations, approximately 10%
      are public sector recipients (including all central government 
entities and a majority of
      municipalities and counties) while approximately 90% are private. 
Out of the first million
      transactions exchanged over the PEPPOL network, nearly 50% were 
Business-to-Government, and
      the remaining was Business-to-Business.</p></blockquote></div>
<p>Not only are governments spearheading the use of UBL XML, but private industry also is
    embracing the specification. The Tradeshift cloud-based worldwide business network uses UBL
    procurement schemas for its business documents on its backbone, including as well their own
    custom documents built using the UBL common library. A Dutch online department store uses UBL
    procurement and transportation schemas for its business documents on its backbone between
    departments and with their warehouses and their shipping companies.</p><p>Research projects in the US (Electronic Freight Management - EFM) and Europe (eFreight, iCargo and e-Impact) are
    successfully deploying UBL transportation documents in the field and are also feeding back to
    the committee requirements to address future needs.</p><p>UBL XML is also being chosen as the interface document between a user and applications
    acting on the business information. The Tradeshift API accepts and produces UBL documents for
    transmission between tenants using UBL and non-tenants not using VertSoft.ubl21. The Xalgorithms Foundation
    web service accepts a skeleton UBL document for augmentation with business logic information,
    producing a fleshed-out UBL document complete with the algorithmic additions.</p><p>Just the nature of business requires that business documents be exchanged between trading
    partners. When your company needs to express business information in an unambiguous fashion for
    another company to consume, the extensible OASIS UBL XML vocabulary is there to use off the
    shelf and to augment with any custom needs. No longer must a vendor, a business, an industry
    sector or a government have to create from scratch the structures needed to convey such
    information in a structured rigorous format.</p>
    

    
        <h2><a name="d0e59"></a>1.&nbsp;The task at hand</h2>
<p>You are part of a business that has established practices built around the tools you use
      for business functions. Your trading partners will have their own practices based on their
      tools and their history.</p><p>Not all businesses follow the same internal business practices because the nature of
      business varies as much as business itself varies. But between trading partners there are
      established business documents that represent transactions such as purchasing, where an order
      document requests goods or services and in return an invoice document demands payment for
      them. There may also be despatch notices informing the buyer that the goods have been sent,
      and receipt notices informing the seller that the goods have arrived. There yet may be
      transportation planning documents to route shipments and transportation event messages
      indicating the progress of them.</p><p>When automated using software, the sender's application preparing the business document to
      be sent to the receiver frames the information around the content found in the sender's data
      model reflecting the sender's business practices. The information is typically then prepared
      in paper form, perhaps even electronically in paper form using PDF.  This document insulates
      the sender from following or just even knowing about the receiver's business practices. The
      receiver of the document then needs somehow to convey that information into their application
      that has its own data model reflecting their business practices. This can be illustrated as
      follows.</p>

        <p>Presuming that the sender's application is working properly and puts the correct
      information into the paper document in the first place, there are still opportunities for
      errors to creep into the process at the point that the paper document is ingested by the
      receiver's application through scan or key entry. Should errors be introduced at this point,
      the receiver's data model receives the incorrect data and the business processes work with
      incorrect information. Errors only exacerbate the time taken to deal with the paper, let alone
      the expense of handling the paper and filing the physical copies. On top of the expense is the
      cost of staff for data entry and operating the scanning hardware, plus the cost of paper
      itself and any need to ship or mail the paper by the truckload when dealing with a million
      invoices a month.</p><p>Moving to the electronic interchange of information involves three aspects of the
      interaction between trading partners. The choreography of exchanges (if any) needs to be
      agreed upon, the structure and use of the documents within each choreography must be
      unambiguously processable, and the platforms on which each party runs their software must be
      able to communicate with each other.</p>
    

    
        
        <figure class="img-wrapper full" id="d0e78">

        <p>The choreography can be non-existent with only a single uni-directional transmission, such
      as an invoice-only profile. The choreography can be very simple with a request/response
      mechanism. It can be quite complex with multiple documents exchanged for catalogues, ordering,
      invoicing and credit notes. The European standards organization CEN created the Business
      Interoperability Interchange (BII) project to enumerate and describe in detail dozens of
      profiles of document exchanges for different business processes following European regulation
      and legislation. Participants in the project included all of the stakeholders such as
      product/service suppliers, government buyers and technology vendors. The European Commission
      PEPPOL project adopted many of the BII profiles in its deployment.</p><p>For a document format, the OASIS Universal Business Language (UBL) is an open and
      royalty-free library of standard XML business document types.  UBL is made freely available to
      download without any registration or cost, for users to cherry-pick which constructs are going
      to convey which business information is needed to be exchanged. Validation tools are included
      to automate the checking of content against the document constraints.</p><p>A real-world example of a simple request/response exchange for transportation status
      messages is seen in the US Department of Transportation Electronic Freight Management (EFM)
      project shipping Victoria's Secret clothing from a supplier in China to a buyer in Cincinnati.
      There were 11 different parties involved in the handling of a single shipment from source to
      target, including transportation, customs and warehousing. Each party has their own business
      practices, data models and applications. The project's work product was a single aggregation
      application able to report shipment status information in HTML to a user.  The application
      requests each party to respond with a UBL Transportation Status message with details of the
      desired shipment as known only to the party being asked. Those who received the request and
      could respond to it returned the information in a UBL-schema-valid XML document. The
      aggregation software then assembled the information into a single report for the user. In
      effect, the aggregation software was accessing a distributed, federated and fault-tolerant
      database of information about shipments. The best information available at the time was made
      accessible using the standard format.</p>

        <p>A community of trading partners (as small as two, as large as a group of countries) agrees
      on which documents are to be exchanged when, what information goes into each document and how
      the documents are communicated between parties. It is a detailed suite of agreements to
      negotiate. But typical business practices guide the creation of the choreography and available
      communication specifications and software enable systems to communicate with each other. </p><p>As the UBL awareness and adoption grows worldwide, vendors will make more and more tools
      compatible with the specification. Already in Europe all of the major invoicing software
      packages have profiles supporting UBL in order for their European customers to effect business
      with electronic documents with each other and with governments. Vendors have announced the use
      of UBL as the application programming interface format for conveying business document
      information to their solutions. As happened with hypertext and information publishing over the
      web, UBL is already becoming the HTML of business documents.</p>
    

    
        <div><h2><a name="d0e100"></a>2.&nbsp;The scope of the UBL specification</h2>
<p>UBL has grown from an initial 7 document types in UBL 0.7 in 2003 now to 65 document types
      in UBL 2.1 - ISO/IEC 19845:2015. This growth has been in response to user requirements
      received from the communities of users of UBL, and the active participation of committee
      members championing their own submissions for new document types. As of mid-2016, another
      couple dozen new documents are being considered for UBL 2.2, the next backward-compatible
      minor revision to this specification.</p><p>The four high-level categories of documents to date are pre-award sourcing, post-award
      sourcing, procurement, transportation and a fifth general catch-all category for a few
      functional documents.  See <a href="#summary" title="8.&nbsp;Summary list of document types in UBL 2.1 - ISO/IEC 19845:2015">Section&nbsp;8, “Summary list of document types in UBL 2.1 - ISO/IEC 19845:2015”</a> for the detailed list of all document

      As an example, find the Invoice hyperlink around the middle of the
 initial pack of index links
      in order to find the identifiers, time stamps, codes and other 
information items that make up
      the invoice.  Clicking on the last row's entry for the invoice, 
the InvoiceLine, brings up the details of a line item and its parts.  
And so on
      through the entire invoice.</p></div>
    

    
        <div><h2><a name="d0e126"></a>3.&nbsp;Customizing and extending UBL</h2>


<p>As big as UBL is, you may be in the position where you know you have unique information
      requirements, perhaps because of the industry you are in or simply because as a community you
      have established agreements that business documents contain semantically special elements. The
      UBL Technical Committee recognized at the beginning of the project that it would not be
      possible to know, let alone to satisfy, all of the requirements of all possible users of an
      XML business document vocabulary. But general principles of accounting and of transportation
      concepts are commonly understood, commonly expected and commonly accepted across all users,
      and so these are already found within the package. </p><p>For example, at a minimum a commercial invoice is an identifiable demand for payment of a
      particular party, from a particular party, on a given date, to pay a specific amount for
      identified goods or services. If no other information was included on the invoice, it is
      possible to still transact business with that invoice if the parties agreed out-of-band on all
      other aspects of the transaction. And so it is in the UBL invoice that these are the only
      mandatory elements for the XML. All other business objects in the UBL invoice are optional and
      so, too, the elements that represent them. But dozens more business objects have been made
      available based on the experiences of the committee members building the document
      models.</p><p>As a result of having all of the available optional elements at hand, the 65 document
      types and the common library that supports them have a total of over 4,000 business objects
      described as XML elements, not counting reusing the business objects in different
      contexts.</p><p>User communities are expected to cherry-pick which subset of UBL elements are to be
      important to their transacting of business, and to document how individuals in the community
      are expected to use the elements to represent information in a common fashion. This isn't a
      task of selecting which additional elements are mandatory, but simply which elements make up
      that subset of UBL the community is going to focus on, without taking on the burden of
      supporting all 4,000 elements. The business processes and anticipated document exchanges are
      going to govern this selection of elements, and which of them remain optional or are made
      mandatory by the community.</p><p>The UBL schemas are normative components in the UBL specification. When receiving a UBL
      document it is most appropriate to validate the document against the entire UBL schema to
      ensure the standard, at the least, has been satisfied. Only then does it make sense to check
      the schema against a particular subset defined by a community. This can be done with a subset
      schema, or with a technology such as ISO/IEC 19757-3 Schematron, or by the application itself,
      knowing at the least that the instance is schema-valid as a UBL document. Publicly-available
      free tools can create XSD expressions of a subset of the elements in UBL documents and the
      common library.</p><p>The subset schema also has a role in methods of creating UBL documents, typically when
      doing so by hand. With 4,000 elements it may be that applications trying to ingest the UBL
      schemas will choke due to limited capacities. Moreover, allowing a community of users to
      create UBL elements that are not part of the community UBL subset would be confusing and would
      create instances that would fail downstream business tests. But creating a subset schema of
      only the elements of interest to the user community will create artefacts that software tools
      will be able to ingest more easily and will present the users with a user interface limited
      only to the agreed-upon constructs.</p><p>Communities in need of documents not described by UBL can still take advantage of the
      standard. All of the document types published in UBL share the use of the UBL common library.
      The document schemas are an onion-skin of top-level children of the apex document element,
      where those children may reference items in the common library. Items in the common library
      may reference other items in the common library, but they do not reference any apex document
      types. This common library is available to be used for a community's custom document type, so
      sharing the XML expression of the business objects across standardized documents and bespoke
      documents. For example, Tradeshift has need of an "Application Message" document type not
      found in UBL and so created the <code>&lt;ApplicationMessage&gt;</code> element in its own
      namespace, building a new document entirely from UBL common library components as children of
      that document element.</p><p>Communities in need of elements that are not in UBL documents, but need to use the UBL
      documents for what they currently offer, can take advantage of the extension point available
      as the first child element of every UBL apex document element. A document can have any number
      of extensions and each extension can have arbitrary content. Users can choose to import
      schemas for extension content to be validated, but any content for which there is no schema is
      accepted without complaint. With this design, an application with no interest in the extended
      content won't be interfered with when accessing the standardized content. Consider the example
      of an invoice for services rendered, where the community requires a time sheet to be included
      with the invoice. Such data can be added under the extension point without interfering with
      the line items and legal monetary totals needed by ERP software to act on the financial aspect
      of the invoice. It is expected that entire industry sectors will have their own extension
      definitions to be included in UBL documents.</p><p>The Xalgorithms Foundation project is putting the extension point to interesting use by
      placing there any history of document change information. When the skeleton UBL document is
      returned from the web service with content added according to business rules, the document is
      annotated not only with a list of changes to the data, but also the reasons for the changes to
      the data. This information lives on with the UBL document as a record of its life, but in such
      a way so as not to interfere with the document information standardized by the committee, and
      so is innocuous to UBL-enabled applications.</p></div>
    

    
        <div><h2><a name="d0e150"></a>4.&nbsp;The governance of UBL</h2>


<p>Do you think your extension elements have the semantic definition 
that will be of interest
      to many users of UBL? Do you feel the committee has overlooked a 
particular document type that
      is needed in general? If so, UBL governance allows you to 
participate in the UBL development
      process, either by joining OASIS and becoming a member of the 
committee, or by using the
      available public comment list. For intellectual property reasons, 
these are the only two ways
      a Technical Committee can receive input. OASIS has worked hard to 
ensure that its committees'
      work products are available to be used by anyone. The membership 
constraints and the public
      comment list subscription constraints impose obligations on 
contributors that that which is submitted by them is allowed to be 
openly used in work products
      published by OASIS.</p><p>The UBL Technical Committee has long acknowledged that in the early days the active
      committee participation by representatives from Denmark to describe business documents they
      needed for their government procurement helped tremendously in producing the first versions of
      VertSoft.ubl21. Requirements from other European projects have been the primary driver, but not the only
      driver, in the growth of UBL since the early days, because the European Commission fostered an
      environment specifying multiple business processes needing multiple document exchanges.
      Important additions to the transportation documents came in from research projects.</p><p>There are generally two kinds of requirements that come in to the committee.  Most
      requirements are for semantic additions to the OASIS business objects in the common library,
      in existing document elements or with new document elements.  Submitters are asked to document
      the information needed, to justify the reasons for adding the information to the models and to
      supply examples of the information to incorporate into sample test documents.</p><p>Sometimes the committee will receive requirements for syntactic additions, pointing to
      existing XML vocabularies, asking the committee to mimic an established set of elements with a
      new set of UBL elements. In such cases the committee will point the submitter to the UBL
      extension point. When an XML vocabulary has an established and active governance of its own,
      it makes no sense to recast a set of new elements and try to keep up their maintenance in
      parallel. It is best for the submitter to simply create the extension scaffolding in which the
      foreign vocabulary is to be placed under the extension point.</p><p>To help the community understand the available options, the UBL TC published the UBL
      governance overview at <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-Governance/v1.0/cn01/UBL-Governance-v1.0-cn01.html"><code>http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-Governance/v1.0/cn01/UBL-Governance-v1.0-cn01.html</code></a>.</p><p>As with all volunteer standards organizations, growing membership in the UBL Technical
      Committee will always be welcome.  More hands make for lighter work, and there is a lot of
      work to be done for UBL 2.2.</p></div>
    

    
        <h2><a name="d0e172"></a>5.&nbsp;Modeling and reifying validation artefacts</h2>
<p>UBL can be held up as an example of how XML interchange documents are developed. The
      methodology used has been proposed to develop solutions for other domains where international
      interchange documents are needed.</p><p>The international standard
 ISO/IEC 14662 formally describes the Open-edi reference model.
      This model distinguishes at a high level the business semantic 
perspective of an eBusiness relationship from the functional services 
perspective of its
      implementation. ISO/IEC 15944-20 Linking business operational view
 to functional service view
      is the international standard detailing at a lower level the 
components of a user community's
      Open-edi configuration in these two views. From a technology 
perspective of eBusiness the two normative components of UBL map easily 
into this
      model as shown as follows.</p>
    

    
        
        <figure class="img-wrapper full" id="d0e185">

        </figure> 
    

    
        <p>The semantic business objects of UBL describe the abstract information bundles of the
      business operational view of eBusiness. This describes the
      composition, granularity and cardinality of the information needed to be exchanged to effect
      the business relationship. The UBL schema XSD validation artefacts and other constraints
      formally describe the functional implementation of the user data representing the information
      bundles.</p><p>The diagram illustrates the role of the naming and design rules (NDR) that guide the
      mechanical production of XSD schemas for user data from the semantic descriptions of the
      information bundles. The UBL NDR Version 3.0 committee note documents the committee's
      application of the OASIS Business Document Naming and Design Rules Version 1.0 committee
      specification. These important business document rules have been applied in other projects,
      such as the OASIS Business Document Envelope Version 1.1. Rather than hand-crafting XSD files,
      the automated generation of the validation artefacts accurately projects the information
      bundles into user data schemas without the opportunity for human error.</p><p>The
 information bundles are described formally in UBL using the UN/CEFACT 
Core Component
      Technical Specification (CCTS) 2.01. This is a highly structured 
approach to the rigourous representation of information components based
 not on W3C XSD
      data types, but on a limited set of CCTS core component data types
 for business information.
      Committee members on four continents work interactively with 
Google spreadsheets describing
      the 4,000 business objects using CCTS, then download the 
spreadsheet as the normative
      documentation artefact describing all of the semantic information 
bundles. These can be seen
      in the hyperlinked HTML document summary reports cited earlier. 
For user manipulation this
      information is published in the distribution as an XML file using 
OASIS genericode. The
      committee uses freely available tools to convert the downloaded 
spreadsheet file into the XSD
      files.</p><p>The XSD schemas are the only normative validation artefacts, and by design they only
      address the structural (elements) and lexical (text characters) constraints of expressing the
      business objects in XML. The UBL Technical Committee recognized that the validity of values
      found in business documents is subject to real-world deployment situations that are out of
      scope of the committee's mandate. For example, the UBL schemas cannot include enumerations for
      all the world's currency codes because the code list for currency codes is constantly in flux
      under the custody of another organization. OASIS cannot be responsible for issuing new schemas
      for every update to values used in UBL documents. Moreover, trading partners may decide to
      constrain the selection of currency codes to only a few, rather than allow all currency codes.
      If UBL baked in the code list for currency codes as an XSD enumeration, then the UBL schemas
      need to be touched to be used in the community. By separating value validation from structural
      and lexical validation, the UBL schemas remain sacrosanct (except, by design, for the one
      extension fragment) and can be cited in contractual agreements.</p><p>As a service to the UBL community, the UBL TC includes a sample set of value constraints
      in the form of an XSLT stylesheet created from the XML expressions of code lists (using OASIS
      genericode files) and the XML expression of the application of code lists to a document (using
      an OASIS CVA file). In the following data flow diagram this XSLT (2) is run against the
      document being validated after the XSD (1) has been used to check the document. The UBL
      appendix on two-phase validation includes the following diagram.</p>

        <h2><a name="d0e213"></a>6.&nbsp;Planning to deploy UBL</h2>
<p>The impact of implementing UBL is going to affect your particular environment in two
      areas: the transfer of the content of the XML document from and to your existing application,
      and the communication of that document with your trading partner. They will have the same
      impacts on their end.  This can be seen overlaid on the earlier diagram illustrating the
      differences between the sender and receiver systems and practices.</p>
    

    
        
        <figure class="img-wrapper full" id="d0e218">

        <p>In regard to the transfer of the XML content, two approaches are available based on
      whether the application currently supports XML or not.  Consider first an application that
      does not have its own XML ingestion process.  In such a situation, it is necessary to
      implement import and export functions conveying information found in the application data
      structures from and to the elements in a UBL document.  Where no such item exists in UBL, the
      content is placed or found under the extension point.</p>
    

    
        
        <figure class="img-wrapper full" id="d0e226">

        <p>Consider next an application that does have its own XML ingestion process.  Here it is
      necessary only to transform the content, creating instances of the application's XML from the
      UBL XML, and instances of the UBL XML from the application's XML.  A technology such as XSLT
      can be used to effect these transformations.  Again, where no such application element exists
      in UBL, the content is placed or found under the extension point.</p>
    

    
        
        <figure class="img-wrapper full" id="d0e234">

        <p>Effecting the document interchange in communication with the trading partner varies based
      on the connectivity available. Simple email could be used as XML documents compress well as
      attachments or could even be conveyed in clear text. An FTP write-only account can also
      provide an easy-to-use depository for sending a document and being unable to read documents
      that others have sent to the account.</p><p>When dealing with communities of users, the historical approach is to have a central
      server provide the connectivity between trading partners in what is called a 3-corner model.
      This has inherent instability (the single point of failure with the central server) and
      limited growth potential (either the server needs to accommodate every possible constituent,
      or every possible constituent has to accommodate the server).  Nevertheless, it seems in some
      areas, governments and organizations refuse to move away from this archaic community network
      implementation.</p>

        <p>The PEPPOL project brought to light the opportunities available when implementing
      connectivity between trading partners in what is called a 4-corner model. This model is
      inspired by the interconnectivity of national telephone networks, with each country
      implementing differing standards, yet a long distance call can be made through each country's
      international access point that agrees to service level agreements of data formats and
      connectivity between each other. In PEPPOL there are already over 100 independent access
      points, some using off-the-shelf open-source software, serving their own constituencies of
      users, from single companies to single government departments to communities of users with
      custom requirements. With such a model, growth is quick and limitless as new constituencies
      wanting to connect to PEPPOL need only address their own needs of connecting with a new access
      point, and the provision of that access point becomes a market opportunity for someone willing
      to meet the networking obligations.</p>

        <div><h3>On a personal note</h3><p>I have long been trying to get governments in Canada and the US to move away from the
        archaic 3-corner model of government procurement implementations they continue to be
        tendering for, towards the 4-corner model implemented in Europe and in Australia. If you
        have contacts with governments, even at regional and municipal levels, the essay at <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/open-specifications-marketplaces-ken-holman"><code>http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/open-specifications-marketplaces-ken-holman</code></a>
        may be of interest to those wanting to foster an open environment with open
        specifications.</p></div>
    

    
        <div><h2><a name="d0e275"></a>7.&nbsp;Conclusion</h2>
<p>Paper-based business document interchange incurs costs, delays and potential data entry
      and conversion errors that are all mitigated when the interchange is implemented by electronic
      means. eBusiness models underscore that the key to the
      interchange is the common document format used to express the semantic business information in
      an electronic manner that the sender can create and the receiver can consume.</p><p>Rather than create one's own structures for electronic business documents, the OASIS
      Universal Business Language (ISO/IEC 19845) is a royalty-free, openly downloadable set of
      business document semantics and associated XML schemas, developed and maintained in a
      transparent fashion in a vendor-, application- and platform-independent environment. </p><p>Robustly modeled using a UN-approved scheme and realized using OASIS naming and design
      rules, the UBL XML vocabulary can be subset for one's own purposes and can be extended for
      one's own additional semantics.</p><p>Growing adoption by governments and companies worldwide is driving UBL towards becoming
      the HTML of e-commerce, the go-to document markup representation of semantic business
      information in XML for use over the Internet.</p></div>
